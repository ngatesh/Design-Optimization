 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.516   TIME= 22:56:34
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.578   TIME= 22:56:34
 Material number 18 (used by element 10600) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 22:56:34
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.22 is defined in the model.  Switch to   
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 22:56:34
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.172   TIME= 22:56:34
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 8008).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.766   TIME= 22:56:35
 Multiple constraints have been applied on degree of freedom 3 of        
 contact node 6209.  The program will remove certain internal MPCs.      
 Please check the model carefully.                                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.766   TIME= 22:56:35
 Or use relaxation option (target element KEYOPT(11) = 1) to overcome    
 the over-constraint.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.094   TIME= 22:56:35
 For element 10600 the element connectivity is 0 and 13192.  The node    
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.188   TIME= 22:56:36
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
