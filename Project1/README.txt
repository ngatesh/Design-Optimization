Hello professor,

On canvas you asked me to let you know which file to read. Everything I did for this project is contained in the folder "Project1". Here is the direct link to that:

https://github.com/ngatesh/Design-Optimization/tree/main/Project1

If you are wondering which file within "Project1" to read, the answer is all of them. I think in your example guide for this assignment the code may have been contained in one long file. I chose to put each class into its own corresponding file to keep things better organized.

The program starts in "RocketLander.py", so you can start reading there. That short script will reference the other classes (Dynamics, Controller, Simulation, Optimize) to run the simulation, much like in the provided example.

Within "Project1" are two folders called "Result Batch Size ONE" and "Result Batch Size TWO". These contain the program output for training batch sizes one and two, respectively. There is some info in the latter which explains why I did not simulate beyond a batch size of two.

There is also a "Setup.pdf" which shows my hand-math with the free body diagram to work out the physics of a rocket with adjustable thrust and thrust angle.

Hope this helps,

Nathaniel Gatesh
